## About This Tool

Email X-Ray is a passive detection tool that scans email HTML/CSS for suspicious patterns. It:
- Runs entirely locally in your browser
- Makes no network requests
- Stores no data externally
- Acts as an information layer only

**This extension does not provide protection** - it highlights patterns for your awareness.

## Reporting Phishing Emails

If Email X-Ray detects threats in an email:

### Report to Your Email Provider
- **Gmail**: Use "Report phishing" option (three-dot menu)
- **Yahoo Mail**: Use "Report spam" button

### Report Brand Impersonation
If an email impersonates a legitimate company:
1. Forward to the real company's abuse/security contact
2. Examples: `phishing@paypal.com`, `abuse@amazon.com`, `reportphishing@apple.com`
